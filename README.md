# Addidas-Sales-Analysis
I designed an Excel dashboard for Adidas sales reports covering the period from 2020 to 2021. The dashboard highlights key performance indicators including total revenue, total profit, total units sold, and average revenue. It also provides insights into profit generated by three sales methods, revenue distribution by state and retailer, and quarterly trends.
